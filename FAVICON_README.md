Add favicons to the `public/` folder so browsers and mobile devices pick them up.

Files to add (recommended):
- public/favicon.ico           (classic favicon)
- public/favicon-32.png        (32x32 PNG)
- public/favicon-16.png        (16x16 PNG)
- public/apple-touch-icon.png  (180x180 PNG for iOS)

Steps:
1. Save your provided image(s) with the names above into the `public/` folder.
2. Commit and deploy. Browsers and social previews will then use the updated icons.

If you want, I can generate the different sizes from the uploaded image (I need the binary in the workspace). If you upload the image file here, I can add the generated icons to `public/` automatically.
