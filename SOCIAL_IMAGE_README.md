Place your custom social preview image in `public/social-share.png` (1200x630 recommended).

Steps:
1. Save the image file as `social-share.png`.
2. Put it in the `public/` folder of the project root.
3. Commit and deploy. The social preview meta tags in `index.html` already point to `/social-share.png`.

Notes:
- Recommended size: 1200x630 (Twitter Cards and Open Graph).
- Keep the file under 200KB for fast loading on social platforms.
- If you want a different filename, update `index.html` and any uses of the image accordingly.
